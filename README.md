Doug the Hacker roamed the wastelands, a man of great skill, known for his prowess in the art of hacking. He was sought by a warlord, who desired to unlock the secrets of the Cybersphere. Doug accepted, and with cunning wit, he hacked his way through, using his knowledge of the Chronozone and the Hypernova to his advantage. But Doug was not swayed by the offers of a being of immense power, and with a burst of his Neoblast, he destroyed the artifact, freeing himself from its grasp. Doug returned to the wasteland, rich beyond his wildest dreams, disappearing into the shadows, a legend in his own time.
